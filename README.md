# TODO-list-Java-script📝 Simple JavaScript To-Do List (Console App)
This is a basic To-Do List app that runs in the browser console using JavaScript. It allows users to add, list, and delete tasks using simple commands.

🚀 How It Works:
When the page loads, the user sees an alert and is asked to enter a command (list, new, delete, or quit).

The app starts with 2 default tasks:

collect chicken eggs

clean cat litter box

✏️ Commands:
list
→ Displays all current to-dos with their index numbers.

new
→ Prompts the user to enter a new task and adds it to the list.

delete
→ Asks for the index number of the task to delete and removes it from the list.

quit or q
→ Exits the app.

🧠 Example Flow:
> enter a command
list
**********
0 : collect chicken eggs
1 : clean cat litter box
**********

> enter a command
new
ok, what is the new todo?
buy groceries
buy groceries added to the list

> enter a command
delete
ok enter the index
1
deleted 1

> enter a command
quit
you quit the todo app
